She was mysterious and weird at first, okay she's still weird but i fell for that weirdness everyday and i'm still falling or better yet i never stopped falling. My heart saw her beauty way before my eyes did and till this day i am forever thankful for being blessed presence, it feels like i have no right to love her but i still do. She deserves the best and i want to be the best for her </p>

        <p class="reveal">I had no idea who she was, where she was from, what her name was and even how amazing she was, all i knew was that i had never seen someone whos soul could ever be so beautiful and with a voice so calming i fell for her over and over again. The day i got her number was the day i lost all sense of reasoning cause i knew for this person i'll do everything and anything just to keep her. I dont know if it was <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.692);">love</span> or obsession or maybe the desire to give this person unconditional <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.644);">love</span> like she deserves. Till this day i still wonder what she saw in me that she fell for and it makes me doubt her <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.664);">love</span> but she has shown me that does doubts are false over and over again and i thank God for being the artist that he is and blessing the world with this masterpiece called Peace or as i would like to call her <span style="color: rgba(255, 196, 0, 0.877);">'my sexy ass girlfriend'</span></p>

       <p class="reveal"><span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; color: rgb(253, 173, 0);">If you asked me who she is</span> i'll say she's Peace 200l law student with a really nice smile and weird personality. She loves cakes, movies, indomie with suya, and shawarma, also her favourite color is red. She's really smart and considerate somtimes also shes an idiot almost everytime</p>

       <br>
       <p class="reveal"><span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; color: rgb(253, 173, 0);">But if you asked me on a deeper level</span> i'll say she's a person not just any person but my person, she's everything that's ever been good in my life, she's the person that my mind has refused to stop thinking about, she's a person with trauma and insecurities too, she's someone who any father would be proud to call his daughter, she was never what i was looking for but i found her and now i can't seem to let go of her, she is someone who has chosen to grow in christ and i am someone who will forever support her in it not because i love her but because more than anything else i want her to be proud of herself just as i am proud of her.</p>
